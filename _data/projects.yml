- name: A Ubiquitination Cascade Regulating the Integrated Stress Response and Survival in Carcinomas
  journal: Cancer Discovery (01 March, 2023)
  descr: "Systematic identification of signaling pathways required for the fitness of cancer cells will facilitate the development of new cancer therapies. We used gene essentiality measurements in 1,086 cancer cell lines to identify selective coessentiality modules and found that a ubiquitin ligase complex composed of UBA6, BIRC6, KCMF1, and UBR4 is required for the survival of a subset of epithelial tumors that exhibit a high degree of aneuploidy. Suppressing BIRC6 in cell lines that are dependent on this complex led to a substantial reduction in cell fitness in vitro and potent tumor regression in vivo. Mechanistically, BIRC6 suppression resulted in selective activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) by stabilization of the heme-regulated inhibitor, a direct ubiquitination target of the UBA6/BIRC6/KCMF1/UBR4 complex. These observations uncover a novel ubiquitination cascade that regulates ISR and highlight the potential of ISR activation as a new therapeutic strategy."

# - name: Sparse dictionary learning recovers pleiotropy from human cell fitness screens
#   journal: Cell Systems (20 April, 2022)
#   descr: "In high-throughput functional genomic screens, each gene product is commonly assumed to exhibit a singular biological function within a defined protein complex or pathway. In practice, a single gene perturbation may induce multiple cascading functional outcomes, a genetic principle known as pleiotropy. Here, we model pleiotropy in fitness screen collections by representing each gene perturbation as the sum of multiple perturbations of biological functions, each harboring independent fitness effects inferred empirically from the data. Our approach (Webster) recovered pleiotropic functions for DNA damage proteins from genotoxic fitness screens, untangled distinct signaling pathways upstream of shared effector proteins from cancer cell fitness screens, and predicted the stoichiometry of an unknown protein complex subunit from fitness data alone. Modeling compound sensitivity profiles in terms of genetic functions recovered compound mechanisms of action. Our approach establishes a sparse approximation mechanism for unraveling complex genetic architectures underlying high-dimensional gene perturbation readouts."

# - name: Microenvironment drives cell state, plasticity, and drug response in pancreatic cancer
#   journal: Cell (9 December, 2021)
#   descr: "Prognostically relevant RNA expression states exist in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), but our understanding of their drivers, stability, and relationship to therapeutic response is limited. To examine these attributes systematically, we profiled metastatic biopsies and matched organoid models at single-cell resolution. In vivo, we identify a new intermediate PDAC transcriptional cell state and uncover distinct site- and state-specific tumor microenvironments (TMEs). Benchmarking models against this reference map, we reveal strong culture-specific biases in cancer cell transcriptional state representation driven by altered TME signals. We restore expression state heterogeneity by adding back in vivo-relevant factors and show plasticity in culture models. Further, we prove that non-genetic modulation of cell state can strongly influence drug responses, uncovering state-specific vulnerabilities. This work provides a broadly applicable framework for aligning cell states across in vivo and ex vivo settings, identifying drivers of transcriptional plasticity and manipulating cell state to target associated vulnerabilities."

# - name: Repeat expansions confer WRN dependence in microsatellite-unstable cancers
#   journal: Nature (30 September, 2020)
#   descr: "The RecQ DNA helicase WRN is a synthetic lethal target for cancer cells with microsatellite instability (MSI), a form of genetic hypermutability that arises from impaired mismatch repair. Depletion of WRN induces widespread DNA double-strand breaks in MSI cells, leading to cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. However, the mechanism by which WRN protects MSI-associated cancers from double-strand breaks remains unclear. Here we show that TA-dinucleotide repeats are highly unstable in MSI cells and undergo large-scale expansions, distinct from previously described insertion or deletion mutations of a few nucleotides5. Expanded TA repeats form non-B DNA secondary structures that stall replication forks, activate the ATR checkpoint kinase, and require unwinding by the WRN helicase. In the absence of WRN, the expanded TA-dinucleotide repeats are susceptible to cleavage by the MUS81 nuclease, leading to massive chromosome shattering. These findings identify a distinct biomarker that underlies the synthetic lethal dependence on WRN, and support the development of therapeutic agents that target WRN for MSI-associated cancers."

# - name: Partial gene suppression improves identification of cancer vulnerabilities when CRISPR-Cas9 knockout is pan-lethal
#   journal: BioRxiv (03 March, 2022)
#   desc: "Hundreds of genome-wide loss-of-function screens have been performed, as part of efforts such as The Cancer Dependency Map, to create a catalog of genetic dependencies in a diverse set of cancer contexts. In recent years, large-scale screening efforts have shifted perturbation technology from RNAi to CRISPR-Cas9, due to the superior efficacy and specificity of CRISPR-Cas9-mediated approaches. However, questions remain about the extent to which partial suppression of gene targets could result in selective dependency across cell lines, potentially revealing a larger set of targetable cancer vulnerabilities than can be identified using CRISPR knockout alone. Here, we use CRISPR-Cas9 and RNAi screening data for more than 400 shared cell lines to represent knockout and partial suppression genetic perturbation modalities and evaluate the utility of each for therapeutic target discovery and the inference of gene function. We find that CRISPR screens identify more dependencies, and yield more accurate predictive models and co-dependency relationships overall. However, RNAi outperforms CRISPR in identifying associations (omics, drug, co-dependencies) with genes that are common dependencies for most cell lines (pan-dependencies). As pan-dependencies occur frequently in the CRISPR dataset (~2,000 genes), using results from both RNAi and CRISPR analyses facilitates the discovery of predictive models and associated co-dependencies for a wider range of gene targets than could be detected using either dataset alone. These findings can aid in the interpretation of contrasting results obtained from CRISPR and RNAi screens and reinforce the importance of partial gene suppression methods in building a cancer dependency map."
