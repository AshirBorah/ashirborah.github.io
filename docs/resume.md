Computational Associate I, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard                               2019 - 2021 
Cancer Data Science, Dependency Map Project, Cancer Program 
Advisor: James McFarland 
●  Lead the computational effort to validate therapeutic genetic targets and find their biomarkers 
●  Develop innovative strategies for discovering new targets from genome-scale screens 
●  Contributed to an open-source machine learning platform that models genetic knockout dependency profiles from 
more than 100,000 genomic features 
●  Modeled the latent variables from  genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screens to discover a new Integrator interaction 
●  Assisted in analyzing the use of RNAi and CRISPR screens as complementary data modalities 
 
  This work has resulted in two publications: one in Nature and one in Cell, and two manuscripts are in revision:   
   Cell Systems and Cancer Discovery.
